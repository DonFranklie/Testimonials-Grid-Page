## Overview
- This is a Front-end Mentor challenge called 'Testimonials Grid Section'. It basically requires one to exercise  CSS skills particularly CSS Grid.
- The project put me on an edge of getting to understand more about the CSS Grid layout.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## My process
Took me some time to build this page. I had to learn CSS Grid because I had not yet learnt it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned
This process intrigued me learning media queries and also how to add A  favicon to a Web page

This what I learnt:

```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="./images/favicon-32x32.png">
```
```css 
 @media(min-width: 1024px)
 ```


If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

I am going to continue doing as many projects as I can on CSS Grid so as to perfect my Grid skills.
I got a touch of Media Queries and onwards am going to continue practicing about Media Queries.

### Useful resources
